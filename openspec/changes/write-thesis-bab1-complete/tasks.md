## 1. Latar Belakang Refinement

- [ ] 1.1 Condense Opinionated Grid description to 1-2 sentences with forward reference to BAB II

- [ ] 1.4 Add mention of tools capability enforcement (sensor=read, executor=mutate) at agent layer
- [ ] 1.5 Simplify progressive complexity model (Level 1-3) to summary paragraph
- [ ] 1.6 Remove or repurpose Corkill_1991_Blackboard citation if no longer relevant
- [ ] 1.7 Ensure research contribution and thesis scope paragraphs are clear and prominent

## 2. Identifikasi Masalah Section

- [ ] 2.1 Write introductory sentence for problem identification section
- [ ] 2.2 Write problem 1: complexity of modern cloud systems requiring unified observability
- [ ] 2.3 Write problem 2: monolithic architecture of AIOps platforms causing vendor lock-in
- [ ] 2.4 Write problem 3: high programming expertise barrier for agentic frameworks
- [ ] 2.5 Write problem 4: lack of declarative/low-code approach in existing frameworks

- [ ] 3.4 Write boundary 3: Kubernetes/SRE as validation domain
- [ ] 3.5 Write boundary 4: MCP/A2A protocols for extensibility
- [ ] 3.6 Add justification for excluding general observability complexity problem
- [ ] 3.7 Format as numbered enumerate list in LaTeX

## 4. Rumusan Masalah Section

- [ ] 4.2 Write RQ1: architecture design with MCP/A2A protocols (Indonesian interrogative)
- [ ] 4.3 Write RQ2: declarative manifest specification (Indonesian interrogative)
- [ ] 4.4 Write RQ3: implementation and validation for Kubernetes/SRE (Indonesian interrogative)
- [ ] 4.5 Format as numbered enumerate list with question marks

## 5. Tujuan Penelitian Section

- [ ] 5.1 Write introductory sentence for research objectives
- [ ] 5.2 Write objective 1: merancang arsitektur framework (maps to RQ1)
- [ ] 5.3 Write objective 2: menyusun spesifikasi manifes deklaratif (maps to RQ2)
- [ ] 5.4 Write objective 3: mengimplementasikan dan memvalidasi framework (maps to RQ3)
- [ ] 5.5 Format as numbered enumerate list in LaTeX

## 6. Manfaat Penelitian Section

- [ ] 6.2 Write Manfaat Teoritis subsection header
- [ ] 6.3 Write theoretical benefit 1: contribution to low-code agentic design patterns
- [ ] 6.4 Write theoretical benefit 2: reference architecture for declarative + standards
- [ ] 6.5 Write Manfaat Praktis subsection header
- [ ] 6.6 Write practical benefit 1: for SRE practitioners (accessible observability agents)
- [ ] 6.7 Write practical benefit 2: for organizations (reduced barrier to agentic automation)
- [ ] 6.8 Write practical benefit 3: for UNY/academic community (reference implementation)
- [ ] 6.9 Format with numbered sub-lists under each category

## 7. Verification

- [ ] 7.1 Verify traceability: problems → boundaries → questions → objectives → benefits
- [ ] 7.2 Verify Indonesian language is formal academic register throughout
- [ ] 7.3 Verify LaTeX compiles without errors
- [ ] 7.4 Review section lengths are appropriate (not too verbose)

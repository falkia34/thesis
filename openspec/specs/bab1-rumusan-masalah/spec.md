#### Scenario: Interrogative compliance

- **WHEN** research questions are written
- **THEN** each begins with "Bagaimana" or similar interrogative and ends with "?"

### Requirement: Three research questions aligned with contributions

The section SHALL contain:

1. RQ1: How to design low-code agentic architecture using standardized protocols (MCP/A2A)?
2. RQ2: How to specify declarative manifest format for agent definition without programming?
3. RQ3: How to implement and validate the framework for Kubernetes/SRE observability?

#### Scenario: Contribution mapping

- **WHEN** questions are reviewed against thesis contributions
- **THEN** RQ1 maps to architecture blueprint, RQ2 to manifest specification, RQ3 to reference implementation

### Requirement: Derivation from bounded problems

Each question SHALL explicitly derive from the bounded problems in Batasan Masalah.

#### Scenario: Traceability

- **WHEN** RQ1 is stated
- **THEN** it addresses bounded problems #1 (agentic approach) and #4 (MCP/A2A protocols)

### Requirement: Numbered list with complete sentences
